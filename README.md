## ðŸš€ Why I Built This
Everytime I would take a quick study/work break I would notice I'd accidentally watch youtube shorts/reels and lots of time would go by, so instead of a 15 minute break it would turn into a 2 hour break. This extension I have made prevents that from happeneing in the first place.
